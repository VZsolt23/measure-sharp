# measure-sharp
This is my first NuGet package, built to practice creating and publishing libraries. It offers easy unit conversions for length, mass, temperature, volume, and more. Featuring a simple API for quick integration, it supports a wide range of units with high precision, perfect for .NET projects of any size.
